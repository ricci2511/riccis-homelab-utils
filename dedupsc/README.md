# dedupsc
A simple CLI program that uses my `dupescout` package to find duplicate files in the given directory, lists them, and optionally deletes them if any are selected.

# warning :warning:
Any selected entries/duplicates will be deleted permanently on pressing `Enter` with no way to recover them, so use with caution. I am not responsible for any data loss.
